DIRECTIONS: This program works like a basic Microsoft "Paint" program does. 
You click the color you want to draw with and then you are able to draw on the frame titled "Simple Sketching Program."
The "Clear Screen" button on the "Toolbar" frame will clear all the markings that you have drawn on the drawing frame.
